# Rada-Akbar-Website
This is a website I built using a free template from https://www.free-css.com/
This is a website I built for my sister who is an artist. The website showcases her artwork and exhibitions. 
This project is a work in progress for me so I continue to edit it and learn as I go but I have launched the website to the public and here is the link for it: radaakbar.com 
I have also launched it using netlify and here is the link for that: https://radaakbar.netlify.app/
Thanks for visiting my page!
